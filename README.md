# CloudWatch-Alarm-Setup# AWS CloudWatch Monitoring – 

## 🔍 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how I used *Amazon CloudWatch* to monitor an EC2 instance’s performance by tracking metrics like *CPUUtilization* and *NetworkPacketsOut*.

## 🎯 Goal
To simulate real-world IT support tasks by setting up cloud monitoring and alerting for resource optimization, helping teams proactively manage workloads.

## 🛠 Tools & Services
- AWS CloudWatch
- EC2 Instance
- IAM (for secure access)
- AWS Management Console

## 📷 Screenshots

## 🧠 What I Learned
- How to analyze instance behavior using built-in AWS metrics.
- Importance of proactive monitoring in IT support roles.
- Interpreting CPU & network performance issues.

## 🚀 Value to Businesses
This kind of monitoring:
- Prevents unexpected downtime.
- Helps IT teams act before performance becomes an issue.
- Saves cost by avoiding over-provisioning of resources.

## ✅ Outcome
The monitoring setup now alerts us when:
- CPU usage spikes over 80%.
- Network packet output behaves abnormally.
